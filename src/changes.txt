   Initial Release:
   -  rel: 23.05.2020, Major Update
   -  sum: Improved file copy and backup, shown in a new script template.
           SFK for Mac OS/X is now available as a 64-bit binary.
           Improved FTP/SFT clients. Mobile friendly web server.
           Improved batch support on linux. Many bug fixes and detail improvements.
   -  CHG: SFK for Windows: now uses the Visual Studio 2015 runtime
           also for 32-bit binaries (it always used it for the
           64 bit binaries). This may cause a one-time recopy of files
           with sfk copy/sync and sft cput, as the new runtime
           interprets file dates in daylight savings time different.
   -  CHG: SYNTAX CHANGE: sfk filter ++word1 ++word2 is deprecated.
           Use instead sfk filter -and+word1 -and+word2,
           or sfk filter "-+word1*word2" to search in given order.
           The "++" will be used in a future version to control
           command chaining data flow.
   -  CHG: SYNTAX CHANGE: script remarks starting like //text
           without any whitespace are now deprecated.
           sfk script, call, perline now require that "//"
           remarks are followed by one space,
           to avoid ambiquities with //pathname UNC paths.
   -  FIX: sfk sel mydir +del a.txt deleted mydir files.
           now the parameter conflict produces an error.
   -  CHG: FTP/SFT CLIENT SYNTAX CHANGE: filenames containing
           whitespace like 'the dir/the file.txt' can no longer
           be typed as is, but must be surrounded by quotes "".
           this is because ftp/sft now allows to add another
           parameter, which is a different target filename.
   -  CHG: errors and warnings are now prefixed by the current
           sfk command name, to find script errors easier.
   -  chg: sfk batch: new example scripts. default is a small script
           with a simple file copy example. added option -full
           to create a large backup example script with different
           commands on the same file set.

           all files of current folder.
   -  fix: -fileset: memory leaks on multiple use
           in subsequent commands.
   -  fix: sfk sel -fileset fname did not work.
   -  chg: warning "cannot read file stat" is now just "cannot read".
   -  doc: sft -showip
   internal:
   -  chg: tcpcon::read now returns -1 on connection close.
   -  add: tcpsend: support for -timeout option.
   -  chg: tcpsend: no longer adds CRLF by default.
           add 0x0d0a for the old behaviour.
   -  add: sfk rerun, sfk sft rerun based on new runtime
   -  add: -noqwild, yet incomplete and just for file selection

   -  del: options -addbin -copy -zip in processDirParms
   -  rv3: FileStat.read did not set utc,
           causing cput time diff with vc14
   -  rv3: added udpcast -revserv, udpget

           in plain text files, but not in binaries.
           use xfindbin to search also binary files.
   -  CHG: Syntax Change: find now only searches
           in plain text files, but not in binaries.

           fixed also related commands like
           sfk samp sfk, sfk samp sfkbash.
   -  CHG: chaining: if chaining is stopped due to missing
           filenames it now shows a notice again by default,
           to avoid unexpected chain stops without any infos.
           the notice can no longer be suppressed by -quiet,
           but as always by -nonote.
   -  fix: option -quiet did not work globally.

   Revision 2:
   -  rel: 03.10.2018, Major Update
   -  sum: added easy installation under windows
           by a double click on sfk.exe, then key 1.
           this copies sfk.exe to a folder c:\tools
           and creates a shell icon on the desktop.
   -  add: sfk base: optional installation when running sfk
           by double click from windows explorer.
   -  CHG: Data Change: sfk index, name under windows
           no longer use files directly within C:\
           but only in a folder C:\zz-index, to avoid
           user local storage in a VirtualStore folder.
           use sfk name -useold to read old index files.
           the new behaviour allows one C:\\ index file for
           all users on the same windows machine.
   -  add: predefined variable: sys.sfkver for sfk version
   -  add: predefined variable: sys.numcols for number of
           columns available in console

   Initial Release:
   -  rel: 18.09.2018, Major Update
   -  sum: added sfk addtovar to collect text lines
           in a variable, sfk crc to create crc-32 checksums,
           sfk difflines to list different unique lines
           between two text files. improved ftp client
           compatibility. many detail improvements
           for scripting, like new variable functions.
   -  chg: Syntax Change: command chaining no longer allows
           data tunneling through non consuming commands.
           in a chain like cmd1 +cmd2 +cmd3 +cmd4 +cmd5
           it is no longer possible to send data from
           cmd1 to cmd3/4/5 if cmd2 uses no chain data
           (e.g. if, tell). this tunneling was inconsistent
           and caused endless conflicts by unwanted chain data
           in cmd3/4/5. use -keepdata or SET SFK_CONFIG=keepdata
           for the old behaviour which was inconsistent
           and worked only sometimes.
   -  chg: Syntax Change: sfk if: no longer passes through
           any chain data, as this behaviour was ambiguous
           and caused endless unwanted chain input.
           this means combinations like
           +xed /a/b/ +if ... +xed /b/c/
           are no longer possible. use '+tif' instead,
           or global option -keepdata.
   -  add: sfk ... +tif for conditional execution
           requesting text and stream data explicitely.
   -  add: sfk ... +tgoto to jump to a label passing
           text and stream data explicitely.
   -  chg: Syntax Change: sfk md5: now only prints the
           checksum without filename if only a single
           filename is given. use option -name
           for the old behaviour.
   -  chg: Data Change: sfk getvar -line no longer
           appends CR or LF at extracted line.
   -  chg: Data Change: web: no longer produces shell
           return code 9 on error, but 1, to be
           consistent with command chaining rc.
   -  FIX: linux: case insensitive pattern match
           and text extraction did not work,
           esp. with xed or xex.
   -  CHG: improved scripting: combinations like
           sfk echo foo +setvar a=text
           sfk echo foo +setvar a +if ... setvar b=text
           sfk echo foo +xex ... +setvar b=1
           no longer require 'then' in many cases.
   -  add: Simple Expressions: tag [skip] at the start
           of a pattern now skips this text completely
           and does not count it as a hit.
   -  chg: archive file extensions: extended the list
           of archive files recognized by -[q]arc by
           more office file extensions.
           for full details type: sfk help opt
   -  chg: no longer activating archive file read
           implicitely with most functions.
           use -[q]arc instead.
   -  fix: ftpserv, httpserv: unwanted listing of
           zip file contents instead of zip file itself.
   -  add: sfk addtovar, append text as lines to a variable
   -  add: variables: #(strpos(a,b)) and #(contains(a,b))
           now searches content of variable b within
           text of variable a.
   -  add: variables: #(begins(a,'word')) now tells if
           text of variable a starts with word.
   -  chg: scripts: #(rsubstr(s,o,l)) now also supports
           offset/length beyond string length,
           producing an empty string instead of error.
   -  fix: scripts: #(substr(a,n)) with n beyond
           length of a stopped the script with
           "invalid variable expression".
           now it evaluates to an empty string.
   -  add: sfk variables: function #(numlines(a))
           to tell number of lines in variable a.
   -  add: sfk md5var, create md5 hash
           from sfk variable content.
   -  add: sfk difflines, show text lines that differ
           between two text files or variables
   -  add: sfk crc, crcgento, crccheck to create
           and verify crc32 checksums (the same as
           used in zip files).
   -  add: sfk list: now sets return code if any
           matching files or dirs were found.
   -  add: sfk web: now sets return code 1 on any error.
   -  add: sfk sft: now sets return code if any
           files were sent.
   -  add: del[tree] now sets return code on failure
   -  add: deltree now retries a failed folder deletion
           2 times with a 100 msec wait inbetween.
   -  add: del[tree] option -stoponerr to stop chain
           execution if deletion fails
   -  chg: del[tree] now produces a warning
           if deletion is incomplete.
   -  fix: ftp client: 30 second wait after listing
           of directory or file download with some servers.
   -  fix: run: -printcmd was ignored.
   -  chg: zip reading: invalid zip file now produces
           a warning instead of an error.
   -  fix: xfind, replace functions, xrename: variables
           were not expanded for dir parameters.
   -  chg: sfk run: now shows a notice if no filenames
           are processed on chaining.
   -  chg: xed, xrename now ignore empty pattern parameters
           instead of stopping with an error.
           useful for scripting with optional parms.
   -  chg: command chaining: -verbose now shows a notice
           "chaining stops before ...: no data"
           if execution stops due to no data.
   -  chg: command chaining: no longer showing
           "chaining stops ...: no filenames"
           unless -verbose is given.
   -  chg: sfk batch out.sh under linux:
           added exit after sfk call.
   -  chg: sfk sft cput: if no files are sent
           then -quiet no longer tells anything.
   -  add: copy -flat2 to copy all files of a dir tree
           to an output folder with relative names.
   -  add: make-random-file -lock option, to keep
           a file locked for testing.
   -  fix: xfind with -justrc: chaining to if
           was not possible if nothing was found.
   -  fix: xfind -showrc produced an error.
   -  add: ifnotexist, check if a file does not exist.
   -  add: swap, reverse chain text character order
   -  add: Windows: sfk clock: pressing enter
           now resets the relative time.
   -  add: Windows: sfk clock3 shows overall start time
           and, when pressing Enter, relative time since
           overall start in a second column.
   -  add: sfk clock2 to show just a relative time.
   -  add: sft client: multi file send: now showing
           total mb info.

   -  sum: further improvements of http and udp message sending
           for easier scripting and convenience.
   -  chg: web: option -cweb renamed to -chainweb to avoid
           ambiguities with new commands. old -cweb is kept
           for compatibility, but no longer documented.
   -  fix: sfk update: always told there was a newer version
           if new version info contained a trailing dot.
   -  add: cweb, an alias for web -nodump -quiet to call
           web url's quick without any output.
   -  add: udp, an alias for udpsend, but does not use
           any chain input data.

   Initial Release:
   -  rel: 06.07.2017, Major Update
   -  sum: syntax corrections with sfk web, addhead and addtail.
           easier web automation in sfk scripts.
   -  CHG: SYNTAX CHANGE: command +web no longer uses chain input
           text by default, so commands like
              sfk filter ... +web ...
           will no longer work. use instead +tweb like
              sfk filter ... +tweb ...
           to explicitely read chain text, or set global option
           -chainweb for the old behaviour. if you need your
           old scripts to run without any changes, set environment
           variable:
              SET SFK_CONFIG=chainweb
           reason: in sfk scripts +web is used most of the time
           with an URL given as a parameter, but not read from
           chain text input, so permanent writing of +then web
           was required. the new default makes web automation
           scripts much easier.
   -  CHG: OUTPUT CHANGE: sfk addhead, addtail no longer
           add blanks between added words by default.
           use option -blank for the old behaviour.
   -  add: sfk addhead, addtail: command chaining support.
   -  add: sfk load: load text or data for further processing
           in a command chain. just like xex or filter,

   -  rel: 03.06.2017, Minor Update
   -  sum: fixed output formatting of multiple variables
           in the same command.
   -  FIX: Output Change: when formatting multiple variables
           in the same command like "#(3.3a) #(b) #(c)"
           then the formatting of the first variable was
           applied to all following. now only the given

           uses plain FTP protocol by default to avoid firewall
           restrictions. use option -sft or SFK_CONFIG=usesft
           for the old behaviour if no firewall interferes.
   -  FIX: ftp server: transfer of folders with most ftp

           old behaviour. this fixes issues that data sent
           by the command chain was always misinterpreted
           as filename lists, producing file open errors.
   -  add: sfk clock, permanent display of absolute and
